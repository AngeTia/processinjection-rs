This repository is a proof of concept for performing Process Injection attacks using the Rust language

- [Compile](#compile)
- [Usage](#usage)

# Compile

First perform the compilation with the command:

```sh
cargo build --release
```
If you are using a different operating system, you can use rustup and add the windows architecture:
```sh
rustup target add x86_64-pc-windows-gnu
```
Then compile specifying the architecture:
```sh
cargo build --release --target x86_64-pc-windows-gnu
```

# Usage 

You can run with cargo run or the compiled binary directly:
```sh
cargo run
```
```sh
processinjection.exe
```
